# Transaction Classification – Supervised Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to classify financial transactions based on various features. The aim is to accurately predict the category or nature of a transaction using structured tabular data. The project involves training and optimizing classification models, evaluating performance, and addressing class imbalance issues using SMOTE.
